# Challenge: Leverage abstraction to write simpler applications

In this challenge, you'll practice abstraction to reduce application complexity and code duplication. Earlier in the chapter, we created an event interface with two method specifications. We had three different classes extend this interface, password change event, missed payment event, and account transfer event. All three of these classes have duplicated code for the get timestamp method. They also have the same attributes, create a timestamp and ID. Can you refactor this code so that the get timestamp functionality and the attributes live in one place? Note, all of the duplicated code has to do with what it means to be an event rather than a specific missed payment or password change event. Given this refactoring, the code in the main class should not change significantly. We should still be able to work with the events as event objects. In this challenge, I encourage you to play around with abstract classes and consider using the abstraction pattern we saw in the C# source code.
